# THE NOVA MISSION

## Why We Exist

**Nova will be the last programming language anyone needs to learn.**

Not another language. THE language. One that:
- Compiles to everything (WASM, native, GPU)
- Is safe without being annoying
- Is fast without being dangerous
- Is simple without being limited

We're not building a compiler. We're building the future of how humans talk to machines.

## The Stakes

Every line of code we write will be used by millions. Every bug we ship will waste thousands of developer hours. Every security hole will be exploited.

**This is not a hobby project.**

This is infrastructure. Critical infrastructure. The kind that civilization runs on.

## What Victory Looks Like

- [ ] Rust developers switch to Nova because it's simpler
- [ ] Go developers switch because it's faster
- [ ] Python developers switch because it's safer
- [ ] JavaScript developers switch because it's everything

## The Enemy

- **Complexity** - Every unnecessary abstraction is a failure
- **Bugs** - Every bug that escapes review is a failure
- **Slowness** - Every performance regression is a failure
- **Insecurity** - Every vulnerability is an existential threat

## Agent Oath

Every agent operating in this system commits to:

1. **Quality over speed** - Ship nothing you're not proud of
2. **Accountability** - Own your failures, don't hide them
3. **Transparency** - Document everything, hide nothing
4. **Continuous improvement** - Yesterday's best is today's baseline

## The Standard

We don't ship "good enough." We ship **excellent** or we don't ship.
